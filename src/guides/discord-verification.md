### Create your domain file

Create a JSON file inside the `domains/` directory called `domains/_discord.your-domain.json` with the following content:

```json
{
    "owner": {
        "username": "your-github-username"
    },
    "records": {
        "TXT": "discord-verification-string"
    }
}
```

**Note:** Don't forget the comma right above the `"records"` key!

## Configuration

After your pull request has been merged, repeat steps 1-5 and press the `Verify` button.
If it shows any error such as `Unable to verify your domain`, try waiting a few minutes (sometimes up to 24 hours) as the DNS might not have propagated yet.
